# The-Little-Frog-s-Way
Early demo version. Will advance into a visual novel.
Please don't steal the code, but in the end it doesn't matter as it's not stealing much than just the game's initial concept..just don't though.
The little frog goes on an adventure to find their pond, meeting many friends and foes along the way. Story will progress more in later versions.
